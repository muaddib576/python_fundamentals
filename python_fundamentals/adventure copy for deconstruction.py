# Polish:
    # Add some delay to the various messages?
    # add flavor text to all descriptions
        # how will player know to pet?    
    # Cleanup/add command aliases
    # make n/e/s/w aliases for north/east/etc
    # Should I split the game out into multiple files? eg one for the PLACES/ITEMS, one for the command classes, etc

# Features:
    # Alissa suggested maybe replacing the "shop" command with a menu in the shop that the player can "read"
        # would need to have the writing dynamically generated. Think about it and discuss with Alissa
        # the "read shop menu" suggestion was about making a clear distinction between the shop inventory and the shop location inventory
    # should I add a sell command? Is there a gameplay reason for this? ...immersion?
    # NOTE: maybe should there be a contingency if more than 1 qty is passed by the player? ""Sorry im confused, how many did you say??""
        # Alissa: start with some GIVEN WHEN THENS to identify what is expected player behavior and then decide what to do

# Bugs:

# Alissa feedback after playing:
    # dragons are easy to deal with once you know which is which
        # Brian's thought: maybe make the health penalty more severe?
                         # Or maybe reshuffle the moods after the player leaves the location? "the red head is moody today"?
                         # Or each head cycles through the options? 

# NILA feedback
    # forgot examine command, maybe should add list of commands?
        # Brian's thought: help command? sign in town the player can read with a list of "accomplishments" from other adventurers? That takes coins to unlock more hints?
